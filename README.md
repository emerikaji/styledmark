# Styledmark

Styledmark is a command-line utility for parsing markdown files into an html file. A css file for basic styling is included and automatically added to the html.

This program is written in Go and uses the [golang-commonmark](gitlab.com/golang-commonmark/markdown) package to parse markdown. Its developers have already made a command line utility with more options; Styledmark is intended to streamline the process for better productivity.
